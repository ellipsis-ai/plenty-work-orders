This skill searches for open work orders on Fiix and presents them for review. Anyone present in the channel can then start a workflow to mark a work order complete by logging how much time was spent.

Work orders can be filtered by the type of maintenance, and by the assigned users. Up to 5 work orders matching the filters will be shown.

You can review a list of open work orders at any time by typing `@{ellipsis.team.botName} list open work orders`.
